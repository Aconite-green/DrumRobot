# Ubuntu-Based CAN Communication Robot Drummer
This project is a unique endeavor that leverages CAN communication to control nine motors within a Linux Ubuntu environment, enabling a robot to play drums. It's designed for music enthusiasts and tech aficionados alike, blending robotics with artistry to create rhythmic music.

## Background and Purpose
This project, led by Dr. Sehyeok Im of the Intelligent Robotics Research Division at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, was embarked upon to merge the realms of robotics and music. The initiative's main objective was to create a robotic drummer, demonstrating sophisticated control over nine motors and real-time processing in a musical context.

Under the guidance of Dr. Im, SeongYong Park contributed significantly to this project by implementing the technology stack and features. The challenges addressed included achieving precise motor synchronization, adapting rhythm generation to various music genres, and maintaining responsive system performance. 

The project's significance lies in its novel approach to blending robotic accuracy with the art of music. Utilizing C++, Linux Ubuntu with a Real-Time Kernel, and the CAN Bus Protocol with the SocketCAN Library, it pushes the frontiers of robotic interaction in musical performances. Additionally, the incorporation of Qt for GUI development, USB IO devices, and proximity sensors, underlines the project's advanced application of technology in an artistic and creative setting.

This endeavor stands as a testament to the potential of robotics in the arts, showcasing how robots can be more than mere tools, but active participants and contributors to the field of music.
